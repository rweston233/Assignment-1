## Assignment 1 Learning Objectives

### Part I
> Getting familiar with MySQL

- Use Workbench to show the SQL to create a table. Save this SQL in a file called `thing_create.sql`
- Insert rows of data into the database using insert statements. Save these SQL insert queries into a single file called `thing_insert.sql`
- Create a query to list all of the entities in the table and order them by one of the columns in descending order. Save this query to a file called `thing_select_desc.sql`.
- Create a query to delete one unique row from the table. Save this query to a file called `thing_delete.sql`.
- Identify columns with repeating data. Save the names of these columns in a file called `thing_repeat.txt`
- Identify one or more columns that if used would present unique data that could be used to identify one and only one entity. Assume you had millions of rows, rather than just five rows. Save the names of the columns in a file called `thing_keys.txt`.

### Part II
> **Be able to define the following terms in your own words.**

- Database Schema
- DBMS
- Primary key

- Surrogate key
- Entity integrity

Save definitions to a file called `definitions.txt`

### Part III
> Based on your area of interest or major, identify and list ten specific instances of how databases are used.
